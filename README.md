# App Assignment:
Develop a web application that visualizes how greenhouse gas emissions have changed over time for the following countries: USA, Japan, China, India, France, and Brazil. The application should retrieve emissions data from the World Bank API and display it in a front-end application built using Ember, React, Vue or any other frameworks or libraries you prefer. It should also enable users to compare emissions across countries and years to gain insights.

# To run this app locally:

1.  Install dependencies:
```
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

2.  Start the development server:
```
npm run dev
# or
yarn run dev
# or
pnpm run dev
```
3.  This command will start the Vite development server, and you should be able to access the React app at http://localhost:3000 or another port indicated in the terminal. Stop the server.


To stop the server, press Ctrl + C in the terminal.



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
